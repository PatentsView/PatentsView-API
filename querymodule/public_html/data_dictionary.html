<h1>Assignees Endpoint</h1>
The PatentsView Query Tool provides an easy to use web interface for querying data on patents, inventors, and assignees from the PatentsView database. Step 1 defines the primary field of the output dataset: patents, inventors, or assignees. These primary fields correspond to the API Endpoints that are described at http://www.patentsview.org/api.
Key terms in the patent data are defined in the glossary: http://www.patentsview.org/api/glossary.html. 
The primary field defines the search groups available to define specific criteria. The table below presents all fields available for searching through the PatentsView Query Tool.
